# Railway-Track-Monitoring-bot
This robot car can detect cracks and misalignments in railway tracks. In this project I have used sensors like ultrasonic sensor for detection of misalignement. E-18 IR sensor is used for detection of cracks. For location tracking and information updation we have used GPS module and bluetooth module.For controlling entire operation we have used ESP 32 controller.
